# favorite-song
A single page Full-Stack Javascript web app that takes user's favorite track and artist and submits it to a database. User has the option to view songs based on the date it was submitted and its popularity. 

Back-end (index.js, routes.js, and song-model.js) was authored by me and used ExpressJS, NodeJS, Mongoose, and MongoDB.
